# VulnOS 2

Find the box [here](http://www.vulnhub.com/entry/vulnos-2,147/)

This is my first writeup for any box, CTF, that I've done. I'm determined not to have to consult the walkthrough, but who knows, I may still need it.

I'm doing this box on VirtualBox. I have been trying to convert all VBox boxes to VMWare lately, but this one wasn't as easy of a conversion as others, so rather than spend more time trying to convert it, I decided to just do it in VBox.

First thing I had to do was figure out the IP address. I ran

```
$ nmap -sT -O 192.168.56.0/24 
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.107 
Host is up (0.00078s latency). 
Not shown: 997 closed ports 
PORT     STATE SERVICE 
22/tcp   open  ssh 
80/tcp   open  http 
6667/tcp open  irc 
MAC Address: 08:00:27:7A:0C:8F (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC) 
Device type: general purpose 
Running: Linux 3.X|4.X 
OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:3 cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:4 
OS details: Linux 3.2 - 4.9 
Network Distance: 1 hop 
```

I discovered that the IP for the vulnerable box is at 192.168.56.107 and that ports 22, 80, and 6667 are open. I've never done anything that dealt with port 6667 yet, but maybe I will now. It's hard to say yet if that's a rabbit hole, or actually helpful. I'm going to try to be a little more methodical on my approach for this box since I am doing a writeup.

Next I run:

```
$ nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/vulnos 192.168.56.107
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.107
Host is up (0.00024s latency).

```

This tells me the same ports that are open but I also find out that ssh is an old version of 6.6.1p1. Ubuntu Linux is version 2.6? Really? This box is from 2016, I guess they used an old version of Ubuntu on purpose? I'm not super sure about that, but we'll see. It's running an older version of Apache, 2.4.7. There are some potentials here. Again, not sure what I'll do about port 6667. I think I'll look at it after I've gone through my usual web side scans.

I decide to use Firefox to navigate to the website at the IP address. I'm greeted with another description of the box and a link to the company website at ```/jabc```. I decide to navigate through the website to see if I can find anything interesting. I find when I view source that this site was written with Drupal 7? Never encountered that yet. I've heard of Drupal but never had to use it.

In the `JABS` tab is a list of products. I see that I can add products to a cart. After I click the `Add to cart` button the URL looks like: `192.168.56.107/jabc/?q=node/4`. I thought that could lead to something but after changing the trailing 4 to different numbers `-1 through 11`; I realize that some pages don't exist, and the ones that do just navigate through the different pages on the site.

On the `Documentation` page there wasn't anything there. I thought maybe something might be hidden. Out of habit I viewed the page source. In it I found:

```html
<p><span style="color:#000000">For security reasons, this section is hidden.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000">For a detailed view and documentation of our products, please visit our documentation platform at /jabcd0cs/ on the server. Just login with guest/guest</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000">Thank you.</span></p>
```
Thank you for keeping that secure.

Let's try out those creds on this login page found at `/jabcd0cs/`. It appears to be run by OpenDocMan. I'm not familiar with that. According to the website `https://www.opendocman.com/` it's an Open Source Document Managment Software. It appears to be outdated too, since the copyright ends 2013. Maybe there's something there. I want to navigate around the portal and see what there is to see.

Using those great creds, I am indeed logged in as *guest*. Cool, there is a tab to add documents. I'm thinking that a web shell might be in play there. I think I'll test the uploader with a php file that prints out the phpinfo: 

`$ echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > test.php`. 

I upload that file and it tells me that a .php file is not supported. I'll try adding .gif on the end of it like `test.php.gif`. 

I upload that file and it tells me that a .php file is not supported. I'll try adding .gif on the end of it like `test.php.gif`. 

**Fail!** It's smart enough to catch the .php in there. Fine I'll just add `GIF89a;` to the beginning of my little test php file...*that didn't work either*. Well, it uploaded my file just fine, but I couldn't view the file. It kept giving me an error. That error may be helpful to someone more experienced, but to me it just means that it didn't work. Maybe this is all just a rabbit hole.

After spending another while trying to get my uploaded file to work I decided to look into exploiting OpenDocMan 1.2.7. I figured there had to be something related to that. This is an old version of OpenDocMan and usually that means there's an exploit. 

I found that if I add `ajax_udf.php?q=1&add_value=odm_user` to the end of my URL that there is a SQLi vulnerability associated with that. I first tried just adding it to my URL as `http://192.168.56.107/jabcd0cs/ajax_udf.php?q=1&add_value=odm_user`. That didn't give me much so I decided to try sqlmap.

I ran command: `sqlmap --url="192.168.56.107/jabcd0cs/ajax_udf.php?q=1&add_value=odm_user" --dbs` 
and it gave me some databases. This was an attempt at exploiting OpenDocMan 1.2.7.

I see that there is a database called jabcd0cs. So I run `sqlmap --url "http://192.168.56.107/jabcd0cs/ajax_udf.php?q=1&add_value=odm_user" -D jabcd0cs --dump-all`

This gives me creds of `webmin:b78aae356709f8c31118ea613980954b`. It appears to be an MD5 hash so I try to hashcat it against the rockyou wordlist while also web searching for some MD5 hash crackers online. My hashcat session exhausts the rockyou list pretty quickly without any result. I try a handful of MD5 hash crackerso online and finally come up successful at https://www.md5online.org/md5-decrypt.html. The plaintext password is `webmin1980`.

I feel like I've exhausted all I can do with OpenDocMan and so I try these credentials with ssh. Running `ssh webmin@192.168.56.107` and the new password gives me a shell. I decided to poke around a little to see if there's anything worth seeing. There is another user `vulnosadmin` but I can't read any of the files there **Permission denied**.

I copy `linpeas` onto the vulnerable machine and run it. As I'm going through the red highlighted text (which means it's really interesting) I notice the Linux version `Linux version 3.13.0-24-generic`. Not sure why I didn't just run a `uname -a` command to get the same info. I've got to remember to run that simple command before doing more complicated time consuming commands. 

I realize that the Linux version is old and so I google search for `Linux 3.13.0-24-generic vulnerabilities`. I come up with https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292 from exploit-db. It seems to be legit so I try `wget`ting it from the website and realize my network isn't set up because I'm using a host-only network adapter. I just copy and paste the code into a file called `ofs.c` on the vulnerable machine. Then I run `gcc ofs.c -o ofs`. Then `./ofs`. Magically, I get a new shell. When I run `id` I realize I'm root.

Getting root was much easier than getting user. I spent a significant amount of time trying to get a reverse shell in OpenDocMan document uploads. But it was fun playing with that. A waste of time, but fun. When I realized I should've tested the OpenDocMan exploit earlier I was a little annoyed with myself, but that's part of learning. üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
